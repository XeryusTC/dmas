\begin{itemize}
    \item[Problem] The use of the internet as a data source and the use of
        robots as brokers of knowledge for a high level autonomous system
        able to process users queries and manage the information
        discoverers.

    \item[State of the Art] Combining semantic web technologies with
        multi-agent systems for integrated access to biological resources.
        (2008)

    \item[New idea] The use of a MAS based framework to combine robots,
        users and web services in an integrated system.

    \item[Results] An implemented system of a robot planning a route using
        a web service over a MAS framework.

    \item[Relevance] A system that can combine Physical agents and
        information from the internet using ontologies.
