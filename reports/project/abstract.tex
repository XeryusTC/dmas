In both the digital and the real world is a lot of information. In an ideally situation we would want to use bot these sources at the same time. In [\textit{An intelligent framework to manage robotic autonomous agents (2011)}], a robot was directed towards a target location using an external path planner. For our project we wanted to improve on this in the context of swarm robotics. In [\textit{Self-organized cooperation between robotic swarms (2011)}] they used two kinds of robots to plan a path through an obstructed environment.  We expanded on this paper by creating our heterogeneous group of robots in a different way.
In our multi-agents systems framework we incorporated these two ideas. We used search robots to collect information about a maze. Rescue robots use this information to go into the maze and collect survivors. The whole process was coordinated by a central brain agent.
The result is a collaborating team of heterogeneous robots that combine real world information and digital information.
