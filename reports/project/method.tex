Our simulation consists of a set of soft bots that try to explore a
randomly generated maze. They use a set of web services to accomplice this
task together. 

\subsection{Simulation Model}
The simulation consists of two web services, two soft bots and a supervisor.
The web services are a data store and a path planner. The data store is used
to store the map, while the path planner can be given a map, a starting
point and a target location. The soft bots are the searchers and the
rescuers. The searchers explore the maze with help from the supervisor,
while the rescuers are sent into the maze to collect the targets. The
supervisor is the link between all these components. It also keeps track of
the already visited locations and the still unexplored locations that can
be reached. The supervisor also makes sure that the searchers are not all
at the some location.

\subsubsection{Data Store}
The data store represents a web service that allows you to store raw data.
It can be updated and queried 

\subsubsection{Path planner}
The path planner represents a web service that uses the A* algorithm
\cite{astar} to plan a route through a grid based maze, such as
\cite{astarweb}.

\subsubsection{Searchers}
The searchers represent robots that can be used for searching through
buildings. They travel through the maze along the straight corridors until
they reach a fork in the maze. Then they call upon the supervisor to give
them a new target to travel to and explore. If they get stuck in a
corridor, they will go through the same process

\subsubsection{Supervisor}
The Supervisor is the central part of the system that makes sure that all
the components work together. It manages all communication between the
separate components and translates the messages that the components send to
each other. It also manages all the searchers and makes sure that they
don't all try to explore the same area.

\subsubsection{Interaction}
Every time the searcher uncovers a new location, it will send a message to
the supervisor. The supervisor will then relay this information to the data
store to store. This information can later be retrieved.

When a searcher gets stuck, it reports its current location to the
supervisor. The supervisor then requests the current map. Then it sends the
map, the location of the stuck searcher and a position that has not been
visited yet to the path planner. The planner will return a path if it is
possible. The supervisor then sends this path to the searcher so it can
resume exploring.
